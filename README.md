# akamai-drm-deobf
Deobfuscation of akamai DRM, they use JSScrambler. This deobf doesn't use any VM or exec, just for fun. The code isn't great, it does work though and tested on 3 versions of akamai DRM.

# info
The DRM can be found on [channel5.com](https://channel5.com), I would make a golang channel5 downloader for a POC, however, I can't stream on channel5 without a residential VPN and that uses so much bandwidth that it's not worth it. If anyone wants to see that, open an issue with a charles log (.chls) of you streaming on channel5.
